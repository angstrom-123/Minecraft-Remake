# To-Do List
## Priority
- Saving edited chunks as files (could just store block array, maybe do RLE?)
- Placing blocks 
- Parallel chunk loading (upload chunk mesh whenever it is finished, then continue)
- Chunk LOD (lower res for distant chunks i.e. 16x16 -> 8x8 -> 4x4 -> 2x2 -> 1x1)
## Non Priority
- MULTIPLAYER :)
- Radial blur god rays (Volumetric lighting)
- Ambient Occlusion
- Add more variety to world generation
- Frustum culling
- Fix drawing order (transparent blocks last)
