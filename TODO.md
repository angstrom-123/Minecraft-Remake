# To-Do List
- Per-instance texture sampling via a "block_type" uniform
    - Texture coordinates can be handled in the shader (no need for atlas.c/.h)
- Save normals for the cubes 
- Directional lighting / shadows
- Dynamic world loading with chunking
- Terrain generation using noise
- Transparent block types such as glass and water 
-
